**Scenario:** Developing an application to predict the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) in individuals.

## Data Requirements:

Previous historical data is needed to help train a deep learning neural network model using pytorch or tensor flow to predict the likelihood of a person to experience Atrial Fibrilation 

A data from the SSC society has been generated with baseline ECG reading and medication history from January 2010 to January 2023 to help train the risk prediction model. The following details are captured in the database:
  - Patient ID
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Disease History
  - ECG readings 
  - medication history

2) Identifying the EC2 instance parameters 
  - memory
  - security 

3) Streamlit
